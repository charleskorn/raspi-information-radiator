raspi-information-radiator
==========================

An Ansible role for configuring a Raspberry Pi as an information radiator, automatically launching Chromium to display a web page in full screen mode on boot.

Notes
------------

* This role will remove `lightdm` and replace it with a lightweight alternative, `matchbox`.
* This role installs the most recent version of Chromium available (22), which isn't very recent and is lacking in many features. If you can find a more recent version, a pull request would be more than welcome :)
* If Chromium exits unexpectedly, it will be automatically restarted.
* If you want to disable the automatic boot to Chromium, remove the file `/boot/xinitrc`. (The boot partition is formatted as FAT32, so you can insert your SD card into a computer to do this if necessary.)

  Note that `/boot/xinitrc` will be recreated if you re-run the role.

Requirements
------------

None. Will install all required packages (eg. Chromium).

Role Variables
--------------

This role has one required variable:

* `boot_to_url`: the URL to display (eg. `http://www.google.com`)

There are also three optional variables:

* `enable_remote_debugging`: whether or not to enable remote Chrome debugging. Defaults to false.
* `hide_mouse_cursor`: whether or not to hide the mouse cursor. Defaults to true.
* `framebuffer`: framebuffer device to use. Defaults to `/dev/fb1`.

Dependencies
------------

This role does not have any dependencies.
